## Argumentative Data Driven Visualisation
Using techniques from Storytelling and the [visualization rhetoric paper](http://users.eecs.northwestern.edu/~jhullman/vis_rhetoric.pdf), I have created two visualizations about a dataset that frame the data with opposite narratives.

The left-side visualization should be rhetorically framed to argue "in support" of the viewpoint, and the right-side visualization should be rhetorically framed to argue against the viewpoint. 

The project proves the importance of rhethorics in data visualisation and how it impacts the reception by its audiences. In current times, we must verify the facts and data before we belive any kind of visualisation.
